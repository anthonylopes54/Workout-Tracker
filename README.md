# My Personal Project

## Lifestyle Tracker

The *Lifestyle Tracker* will be designed to allow users to track their lifestyle habits
in an efficient and convenient manner so users can better achieve their lifestyle goals.

The *Lifestyle Tracker* will:
- Store/add custom workouts and workout templates
- Supply a database of preset workout routines for users to choose from
- Allow users to classify their favourite workouts
- Allow users to view their workouts from a weekly perspective

This application will be used by anyone trying to track or better their exercise habits.
This includes exercise professionals, athletes, recreational gym-goers and many more types of people!

This project is of interest to me because I am heavily involved in the fitness community and have 
a strong background in the field of kinesiology. It is my intentions to expand on this application
after the course of the term by making it more personalized to exercise professionals. For example,
 it would be ideal to have a database of workouts available to each client, accessible by both the client
 and trainer to enhance communication between the two individuals. Furthermore, such a tool would be useful 
 in expanding my own personal training ventures.
